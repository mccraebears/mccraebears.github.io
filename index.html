	<p>Hi! My name is Scott, and these days I'm a Master's student at UC Berkeley.</p>
	<p>I work in the <a href="www-video.eecs.berkeley.edu">VIP Lab</a> (advised by Prof. Avideh Zakhor), which is affiliated with <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu">BAIR</a>. In the fall, I'll be heading back to Dropbox. 
	<br>
	<h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2D and 3D computer vision</li>
            <li>Natural language processing</li>
            <li>Representation learning</li>
        </ul>	
    </p>

    <p>Sometimes, when I'm not working on computer vision, I take <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jqdhi669u8mefma/AAAlC9-lvH6zP4YHi-mAJbzsa?dl=0">pictures</a>.</p>
